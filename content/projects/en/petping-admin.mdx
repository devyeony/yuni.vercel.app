## 🚀 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 🔐 Transition to Secure Account & Permission Management
**Problem:** Shared admin account posed serious security and auditing risks  
**Solution:**  
- Built a custom authentication and authorisation system using **Spring Security**  
- Integrated **Google OAuth2** (company accounts only) and **OTP-based two-factor authentication**  
- Introduced **role-based access controls** with conditional menu rendering

---

### ⚙️ Choosing a Maintainable Architecture for Solo Development
**Problem:** Separate frontend/backend architecture was resource-heavy for a solo developer  
**Solution:**  
- Adopted **Thymeleaf SSR architecture**, enabling tight Spring Boot integration  
- Avoided frontend build step, reducing deployment complexity and maintenance overhead

---

### 📞 API Log Viewer for Improved Customer Support
**Problem:** External logging tool (Airbridge) couldn’t trace API flows per user  
**Solution:**  
- Built an in-admin API call tracker per user, displaying request/response data  
- Enabled faster debugging and improved support accuracy

---

### 🗺️ Visualising Walk Data for Event Ops
**Problem:** Lack of location visibility made event validation and bug tracing inefficient  
**Solution:**  
- Integrated **Naver Maps API** to visualise walk paths and POIs  
- Enabled the team to verify walk events and respond to queries visually and intuitively

---

### 🤖 Automating Repetitive Exception Cases
**Problem:** Some exceptional cases (e.g. manual reward handling) required SQL scripts  
**Solution:**  
- Developed **UI-based exception handling tools** for non-developers  
- Enabled real-time, error-free resolution by the operations team

---

### 📧 Flexible Email Handling for Insurance Claims
**Problem:** Operators couldn't view sent emails or handle failures  
**Solution:**  
- Implemented tools to **view/download claim files**, **resend emails**, and **edit recipients**  
- Empowered operators to respond independently, reducing reliance on developers

---

## 📈 Results
- 🚀 **2× increase in operational throughput** via process automation  
- 😊 **30% rise in operator satisfaction**, thanks to intuitive UI and admin tools  
- ⚡ **40% faster CS response times** with unified data views and logs  
- 🎯 **85%+ reward utilisation** maintained through real-time monitoring  
- 🗺️ **25% drop in event ops time**, enabled by location-based data visualisation  
- 🔐 **Strengthened security** with OAuth2 and OTP two-factor authentication
