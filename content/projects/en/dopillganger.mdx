## 📌 Project Name
- **doPILLganger**

## 📋 Project Summary
- **doPILLganger** is an **AI-powered mobile app**. Its name combines <b>“pill”</b> with <b>“doppelgänger”</b>, reflecting its purpose – to help users **find local medicines similar to the ones they usually take**.
- The app was developed while I was living in **Ireland**, as part of **the National AI Challenge hackathon** organised by **TechIreland**.
- Users simply take a **photo of their medication packaging**, and the app employs **image analysis** and **ingredient extraction** to suggest **local alternatives** containing **similar ingredients**. It also displays nearby chemists and availability, helping people overcome language barriers and uncertainty when purchasing medicine abroad.

## 📅 Duration
- August 2024
